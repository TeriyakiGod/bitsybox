   about running applications
   downloaded from the internet -
   select "Open" again

   to run bitsybox normally by
   double-clicking!

== note for linux / raspberrry pi ==
there are two different builds included:
- bitsybox (statically linked)
- bitsybox_dyn (dynamically linked)

use bitsybox_dyn if you want to supply your own version of SDL2

== tune tool demo ==
this version of bitsybox includes a demo of the tune tool running within bitsybox!

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- this demo is very experimental!
- expect bugs, and an unfinished/unpolished UI
- you *cannot* save tunes you create in this demo

controls:
- launch demo: from the bitsybox main screen hold the menu button (ESC on keyboard, START on gamepad) for a few seconds to launch the tune tool demo
- tune editing: use your mouse to add and remove notes, or change the selected bar
- show/hide tool menu: press the menu button to hide/show the menus for play/pause, instrument selection, arpeggiation, and other settings
- menu navigation: use arrow keys or d-pad to navigate between menu items, use the ok button (space, enter, or face buttons) to select/confirm an item
- quitting demo: to return to the bitsybox main screen, open the tool menu, navigate to the "tune" submenu, select "quit", and press the ok button
